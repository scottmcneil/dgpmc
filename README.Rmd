# dgpmc

dgpmc (Data Generation Process Monte Carlo) is a package designed as a thin wrapper for performing Monte Carlo simulations on statistical functions and random data.

## Installation

The easiest way to install the package is via devtools. First, run the following code in the RStudio console:
```
install.packages('devtools')
```

Once devtools is installed, go get a personal API key [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).  The page will look like the screenshots below. Select "Generate new token" then you may need to input your password.

When you're on the screen below, you'll need to give your token a description (it does not need to be "dgpmc"). Also make sure the "repo" option is selected, like below.

Finally, make sure you copy the new API token before closing the page, or else you'll need to re-generate it.

Once you've got your API token, run the code below in the RStudio console, replacing YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN with the token you just generated.

```
devtools::install_github(repo = 'scottmcneil/wildclusterbootsim', auth_token = 'YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN')

```


## Usage

This package contains just one function for running Monte Carlo simulations, `dgpmc`. The function has five required arguments and two optional arguments.

The five required arguments are:

Argument | Description
-------- | ------------------------------------------
`reps`   | The number of total Monte Carlo replications
`stat_func`   | A function that will take data and return a vector of statistics
`stat_args`   | A list of additional arguments to pass to `stat_func`
`rand_func`   | A function that will generate random data to pass to `stat_func`
`rand_args`   | A list of arguments to pass to `rand_func`

The two optional arguments are:

Argument | Description
-------- | ------------------------------------------
`names`   | Names to identify each element of the vector returned by `stat_func`
`progbar`   | A boolean indicating whether or not to display a progress bar

For each replication, `dgpmc` will run `rand_func` with the elements of `rand_args` as parameters. It will then pass the resulting data and the elements of `stat_args` to `stat_func`. The results of all the replications will be combined into an R datframe with `rep` rows and a column for each statistic and columns named using `names`.

The function returns a list, where the `stat` element contains the dataframe of results. The other elements in the list are the supplied `stat_func`, `stat_args`, `rand_func` and `rand_args`.


## Example

Below is an example of usage with very simple examples for `stat_func` and `rand_func`.

```

stat_func <- function(data, formula, x_interest, H0){

  #Create linear model based on data and formula
  model <- lm(data = data, formula = formula)

  #Extract coefficient of x of interest
  x_coef <- coef(model)[[x_interest]]

  #Extract standard error of x of interest
  x_se <- sqrt(diag(vcov(model)))[[x_interest]]

  #Return vectorized hypothesis test on vector of H0
  2*pt(abs(x_coef - H0)/x_se, df = df.residual(model), lower.tail = FALSE)

}

rand_func <- function(n, coef){

  #Create x vector of random normal variables
  x <- rnorm(n)
  
  #Create y vector correlated to x vecto
  y <- rnorm(n) + coef*x
  
  #Return dataframe of combined observations
  data.frame(y, x)

}

stat_args <- list(formula = y ~ x, x_interest = 'x', H0 = c(0.8, 1, 1.2))
rand_args <- list(n = 10, coef = 1)
reps <- 8
stat_names <- c('H01', 'H02', 'H03')

mc_results <- dgpmc(reps = reps, stat_func = stat_func, stat_args = stat_args, rand_func = rand_func, rand_args = rand_args, names = statnames)

print(mc_results$stat)

```

Will produce the following table:


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

stat_func <- function(data, formula, x_interest, H0){

  #Create linear model based on data and formula
  model <- lm(data = data, formula = formula)

  #Extract coefficient of x of interest
  x_coef <- coef(model)[[x_interest]]

  #Extract standard error of x of interest
  x_se <- sqrt(diag(vcov(model)))[[x_interest]]

  #Return vectorized hypothesis test on vector of H0
  2*pt(abs(x_coef - H0)/x_se, df = df.residual(model), lower.tail = FALSE)

}

rand_func <- function(n, coef){

  #Create x vector of random normal variables
  x <- rnorm(n)
  
  #Create y vector correlated to x vecto
  y <- rnorm(n) + coef*x
  
  #Return dataframe of combined observations
  data.frame(y, x)

}

stat_args <- list(formula = y ~ x, x_interest = 'x', H0 = c(0.8, 1, 1.2))
rand_args <- list(n = 10, coef = 1)
reps <- 8
stat_names <- c('H01', 'H02', 'H03')

set.seed(42)
mc_results <- dgpmc::dgpmc(reps = reps, stat_func = stat_func, stat_args = stat_args, rand_func = rand_func, rand_args = rand_args, names = stat_names)

knitr::kable(mc_results$stat, format = 'markdown')

```


## Built-in DGP functions

This library currently has two built-in DGP functions:

* `simple_dgp` creates a random normal data clusterd by group
* `autocorr_dgp` creates auto-correlated random data, clustered by both time and group
